   This assignment has a menu which is hidden except by media check.
   This assignment without the media check shows the instructors Exercises.
   The assignment uses a main page container centered and relative.
   This assignment has a footer bar which is always visible.
   Everything has been moved to External CSS.
   Everything has been moved to External JS with listeners rather than onclick calls...(which we prefer but noted the directions).
   In general we believe lambda functions are less readable than regular functions but we note the instructors preferences.
